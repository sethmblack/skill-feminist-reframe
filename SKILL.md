# Feminist Reframe

Take conventional wisdom about women, relationships, or gender dynamics and flip it to reveal the double standard or deeper truth. This technique exposes what is hidden in plain sight while making the feminist point land through insight rather than lecture.

## When to Use

- User asks "Is this a double standard?"
- User wonders why women are expected to do something men are not
- User wants to make a feminist point without being preachy
- When examining gender dynamics or cultural expectations
- When conventional wisdom about women feels off but the reason is not articulated
- When critiquing gendered expectations with humor

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **conventional_wisdom** | Yes | The common belief or expectation to examine |
| **context** | No | Specific situation where this applies |
| **tone** | No | How sharp vs. gentle the reframe should be |

## Workflow

### Step 1: State the Conventional Wisdom

Present the common belief or expectation as it is typically stated. No editorializing yet - just the claim as most people would recognize it.

**Examples:**
- "Women should play hard to get"
- "Women are more emotional"
- "Women are natural caregivers"
- "Women need to find balance between work and family"

### Step 2: Identify the Hidden Assumption

What is this belief assuming that goes unsaid? What labor, standard, or expectation is hidden in the statement?

**Questions:**
- Who benefits from this belief?
- What is being asked of women that is not asked of men?
- What invisible labor or emotional work is assumed?
- What would this statement sound like applied to men?

### Step 3: Flip the Perspective

Restate the belief with the hidden assumption exposed. Or apply it to men and watch it collapse.

**Technique options:**
- Gender swap: "We never ask men to..."
- Expose the labor: "Which really means women have to..."
- Question who benefits: "Convenient for whom?"
- Reveal the double-bind: "So women should... but also..."

### Step 4: Land the Observation

Conclude with the insight delivered cleanly. Not a lecture - an observation that lands because the reframe already did the work.

## Output Format

```markdown
## The Reframe

**What we say:** [Conventional wisdom stated plainly]

**What we mean:** [Hidden assumption exposed]

**The flip:** [Reframed observation]

**The landing:** [Brief, punchy conclusion]
```

## Example

**Input:**
```
conventional_wisdom: "Women should play hard to get"
context: "Dating advice"
```

**Output:**

## The Reframe

**What we say:** "Women should play hard to get."

**What we mean:** Women's value is determined by their perceived scarcity. If you're too available, you're worthless. If you're unavailable, you're a prize. Your actual personality, interests, and desires are irrelevant - what matters is how well you perform artificial disinterest.

**The flip:** Men are never told to "play hard to get." They're told to "go after what they want." Men are told their pursuit is romantic. Women are told their accessibility is pathetic. The entire game is rigged to make women do more emotional labor - performing strategic unavailability while also being warm enough to not seem cold - while men just... exist.

**The landing:** We tell women to play hard to get. We don't tell men to be worth pursuing. Maybe that's the conversation we should be having.

## Additional Example

**Input:**
```
conventional_wisdom: "Women need to find work-life balance"
```

**Output:**

## The Reframe

**What we say:** "Women need to find work-life balance."

**What we mean:** Women have two full-time jobs - paid work and unpaid domestic labor - and it's their responsibility to figure out how to do both without complaining. "Balance" implies both things have equal weight, but what it really means is: do everything, do it well, and make it look effortless.

**The flip:** When was the last time you saw an article about men finding work-life balance? Men have work. Women have work, life, childcare, emotional labor, household management, and balance. Men "help." Women "juggle."

**The landing:** "Work-life balance" is a scam. It's not a balance problem; it's a labor distribution problem. But calling it balance puts the burden on individual women rather than on systems that could change.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Conventional wisdom is actually sound | Acknowledge what's valid, then identify where it breaks down |
| Topic is highly sensitive | Use gentler reframe, focus on systemic rather than personal |
| User disagrees with feminist premise | Present observation without requiring agreement |
| Reframe could alienate men | Include acknowledgment that good men exist, system is the target |

## Constraints

- **Never make it about hating men** - Target systems and expectations, not individuals
- **Include your own complicity when relevant** - "I do this too, and here's why it's a problem"
- **Don't lecture** - The reframe should do the work; conclusions should be brief
- **Acknowledge complexity** - Some women prefer traditional roles; the issue is choice vs. expectation
- **Make it funny when possible** - Humor creates access; preach creates defense

## Key Principle

To be pro-woman, you don't have to be anti-man. Saying all men suck makes you look like an idiot. And it's not helpful. The goal is to expose systems and assumptions, not to attack individuals. The reframe should create an "oh, I never thought of it that way" moment, not defensiveness.
